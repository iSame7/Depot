/**
 Swift Struct cann't coform to NSCoder protocol.
 Since we know that we can’t associate NSCoder with our struct, we need to figure out another way to deal with it. We use a protocol.
 Since property lists are just NSDictionary objects, we need to make sure that anything that conforms to PropertyListReadable is able to create and take in NSDictionary objects.

 - I created a playground that contains the code that describe how to persist struct. Kindly follow the URL here:
 [StructPersistorSwiftPlayground](https://github.com/iSame7/StructPersistorSwiftPlayground "StructPersistorSwiftPlayground")
